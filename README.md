# overview
It is based on two python

1.Function-Based Code: This code contains multiple functions that perform tasks like calculating the sum of prime numbers, converting lengths, counting consonants, and checking palindromes based on user input.
Features:
The program picks a random number between 1 and 100.
You guess a number and get feedback if it's too low, too high, or correct.
Tracks how many attempts you take to guess correctly.
How to Play:
Enter a guess between 1 and 100.
The program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Keep guessing until you get it right.


2.Game-Based Code: This code includes two interactive games (Guess the Number and Rock Paper Scissors) where the user competes against the computer, with the option to exit at any time.
Features:
Choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
The computer randomly selects one of those options.
The game follows classic rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.
How to Play:
Type "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
The computer chooses, and the winner is determined.
You can play multiple rounds or type "exit" to stop.
