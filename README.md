It is based on two python
 
 1.Function-Based Code: This code contains multiple functions that perform tasks like calculating the sum of prime numbers, converting lengths, counting consonants, and checking palindromes based on user input.
 
 Features:
 The program picks a random number between 1 and 100.
 You guess a number and get feedback if it's too low, too high, or correct.
 Tracks how many attempts you take to guess correctly.
 
 How to Play:
 Enter a guess between 1 and 100.
 The program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
 Keep guessing until you get it right.
 
 
 2.Game-Based Code: This code includes two interactive games (Guess the Number and Rock Paper Scissors) where the user competes against the computer, with the option to exit at any time.
 
 Features:
 Choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
 The computer randomly selects one of those options.
 The game follows classic rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.
 
 How to Play:
 Type "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
 The computer chooses, and the winner is determined.
 You can play multiple rounds or type "exit" to stop.
